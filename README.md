Student-Mania 

StudentMania â€“ Communication is the key right now. For our project, we wanted to develop a communication website for students to aid in online communication and learning. Adapting to new online learning methods is one of the most significant changes for students during this pandemic. In this day and age, communication is the most important factor in education. Online learning and communication between students and lecturers are at the forefront of planning and discussion, thanks to platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Learn Online, and Discord, to name a few.
