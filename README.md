# 4th Year Project 
## Student-Mania - Platform for Students <br>
This repository contains the final year project for Applied Project and Minor Dissertation for Stephen Gallagher, Kevin Flanagan and Jack Haugh. For our project, We created a student-aimed application that intergrated WebRTC for video chat, cloud based application deployed to a domain online using Amazon's web services (AWS) Amplify and cloud based server on MongoDb to save information to it and it uses AWS Elastic Beanstalk. We also intergrated a chat system and authentication into the website and our goal was to make it user friendly for students to use.

### Contents of Repository
1. Our application deployed to our domain online for use at any time. Created with React.
2. Our Dissertation made and complied on Overleaf using LaTeX. 

### Technology used during development
1. WebRTC - For video call chat
2. MongoDb - For storing information that the user can add in pages
3. Google Firebase - For authentication for user to create or login with an account to access site.
4. AWS Cloud - For making our website and mongo server cloud based for use globally.
5. Chat Engine - For users to chat their own section. 

### How to run application
The user can run the application in two different ways:

1. By going to the url 'https://www.student-mania.com/home' and the user can create an account to access the website and its features.
2. By cloning the repository 'https://github.com/GallagherStephen/4thYearProject-Dissertation.git' in the command prompt in an empty folder and from here you 'cd 4thYearProject-Dissertation' then next you 'cd my-app' and then 'npm start' to run the application locally. P.S. the user might have to add firebase to their machine to work with the authentication which is simply entering 'npm install firebase'.
