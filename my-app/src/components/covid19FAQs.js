                      <h4>Where did COVID-19 come from?</h4>
                      <p>
                      The first known infections from SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. 
                      The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, 
                      as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.
                       Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market,
                       it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. 
                       However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, 
                       which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.

                      <h4>Who is at risk for coronavirus?</h4>
                      <p>
                      The virus that causes COVID-19 infects people of all ages. However,
                      evidence to date suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease.
                      These are older people (that is people over 60 years old); and those with underlying medical conditions 
                      (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer).
                      The risk of severe disease gradually increases with age starting from around 40 years.
                      It's important that adults in this age range protect themselves and in turn protect others that may be more vulnerable.
                      WHO has issued advice for these two groups and for community support to ensure that they are protected from COVID-19 without being isolated, stigmatized,
                      left in a position of increased vulnerability or unable to access basic provisions and social care.
